## Want to contribute?

*__PLEASE NOTE:__ All changes in code must go to `source` directory! `raphboard.js` is a generated file!*

### Setting Up Your Environment
RaphBoard uses [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate some build tasks (generating / minifying raphboard.js, etc.).
So before you get started, you'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.  Then you can simply clone
the repo, install the necessary node modules, and run grunt:

    git clone git clone git://github.com/MiroHibler/RaphBoard.git
    cd raphboard
    npm install
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    grunt (--help to see available options)

### Source Code
To get started, here are some highlights of the directory structure:

* `build/` - output directory for all files generated by grunt (raphboard.js, raphboard.min.js, raphboard.zip, etc.).
* `demos/` - examples of embedding RaphBoard.
* `source/` - RaphBoard source files.

After adding your changes, execute `grunt` in the project folder to generate the minified version, commit and you are ready to make a pull request!

## Found an issue?

 1. Google for similar issues to make sure you don't repeat an existing one;
 2. Ask for help on [RaphBoard forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/raphboard);
 3. Create a fiddle ([boilerplate](http://jsfiddle.net/MZwAW/)) recreating the bug so we can find out what the problem is more easily (or be a hero and find it yourself and send a pull request!). You can also use the [RaphBoard playground](http://MiroHibler.github.io/RaphBoard/playground.html) to reproduce your issues.
 4. Finally, create an [issue](https://github.com/MiroHibler/RaphBoard/issues) and emember to add all the info that can be useful such as:

 * error details
 * steps to reproduce
 * browser and its version
 * any suggestion of what do you think the problem could be
